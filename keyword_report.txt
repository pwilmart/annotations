Signal	Domain	Protein which has a signal sequence, a peptide usually present at the N-terminus of proteins and which is destined to be either secreted or part of membrane components. The signal sequence (usually 20-30 amino acids long) interacts with the signal recognition particle and directs the ribosome to the endoplasmic reticulum where co-translational insertion takes place. Signal peptides are highly hydrophobic but have some positively charged amino acids. Normally, the signal sequence is removed from the growing peptide chain by specific peptidases (signal peptidases) located on the cisternal face of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Disulfide bond	PTM	Protein which is modified by the formation of a bond between the thiol groups of two peptidyl-cysteine residues. The process of chemical oxidation that forms interchain disulfide bonds can produce stable, covalently linked protein dimers, multimers or complexes, whereas intrachain disulfide bonds can contribute to protein folding and stability. Depending on the protein environment, some disulfide bonds are more labile, forming transient redox-active disulfide bonds that are alternately reduced and oxidized in the course of an enzymatic reaction.		168	ALBU_HUMAN; TRFE_HUMAN; HPT_HUMAN; A2MG_HUMAN; APOA2_HUMAN; CO3_HUMAN; FETUB_HUMAN; HEMO_HUMAN; VTDB_HUMAN; IC1_HUMAN; CO4B_HUMAN; CERU_HUMAN; PLMN_HUMAN; C4BPA_HUMAN; CFAH_HUMAN; ANT3_HUMAN; CFAH_HUMAN; ITIH4_HUMAN; A1AG2_HUMAN; A2MG_HUMAN; CFAB_HUMAN; RET4_HUMAN; VTNC_HUMAN; AFAM_HUMAN; FETUA_HUMAN; APOB_HUMAN; APOH_HUMAN; IGLL1_HUMAN; TRFE_HUMAN; C1QA_HUMAN; THRB_HUMAN; IGJ_HUMAN; CO5_HUMAN; CLUS_HUMAN; AMBP_HUMAN; A2AP_HUMAN; KNG1_HUMAN; ANGT_HUMAN; CO9_HUMAN; CO8B_HUMAN; FINC_HUMAN; GELS_HUMAN; CD5L_HUMAN; TETN_HUMAN; ITIH1_HUMAN; PROS_HUMAN; CO2_HUMAN; FIBA_HUMAN; CO8A_HUMAN; CAMP_HUMAN; LG3BP_HUMAN; CO7_HUMAN; CFAI_HUMAN; C1S_HUMAN; C1R_HUMAN; CBPB2_HUMAN; CO6_HUMAN; PRDX1_HUMAN; SODE_HUMAN; CAMP_HUMAN; A2GL_HUMAN; FIBB_HUMAN; FA9_HUMAN; C1QB_HUMAN; ITIH2_HUMAN; C4BPB_HUMAN; LUM_HUMAN; CO8G_HUMAN; CD14_HUMAN; PROP_HUMAN; APOM_HUMAN; ADIPO_HUMAN; SODC_HUMAN; APOD_HUMAN; FBLN1_HUMAN; FIBG_HUMAN; LYSC_HUMAN; CO3_HUMAN; LCAT_HUMAN; PRDX2_HUMAN; PROC_HUMAN; IBP3_HUMAN; PIGR_HUMAN; PSPB_HUMAN; F13B_HUMAN; TRFL_HUMAN; CFAD_HUMAN; HGFA_HUMAN; FA10_HUMAN; CCL14_HUMAN; FBLN3_HUMAN; MASP1_HUMAN; PLF4_HUMAN; THIO_HUMAN; TFR1_HUMAN; HABP2_HUMAN; CATS_HUMAN; CBPN_HUMAN; FOLR1_HUMAN; B2MG_HUMAN; CXCL7_HUMAN; SLPI_HUMAN; CYTC_HUMAN; IBP2_HUMAN; MIME_HUMAN; FA11_HUMAN; BGH3_HUMAN; RNAS2_HUMAN; CD86_HUMAN; LBP_HUMAN; IL1AP_HUMAN; FIBA_HUMAN; PAEP_HUMAN; PRG4_HUMAN; C4BPA_HUMAN; PAEP_HUMAN; CNTN1_HUMAN; LAMP2_HUMAN; HYAL1_HUMAN; IBP6_HUMAN; TSP4_HUMAN; TSP1_HUMAN; PLTP_HUMAN; BPIA1_HUMAN; NECT2_HUMAN; SAP_HUMAN; LFA3_HUMAN; ELNE_HUMAN; VASN_HUMAN; VWF_HUMAN; DMBT1_HUMAN; MASP2_HUMAN; COMP_HUMAN; PEPA5_HUMAN; LAMP1_HUMAN; SPB10_HUMAN; FA7_HUMAN; NPTX2_HUMAN; EDNRB_HUMAN; CMGA_HUMAN; ATRN_HUMAN; CSF1R_HUMAN; MERTK_HUMAN; CATC_HUMAN; CPN2_HUMAN; 4F2_HUMAN; DAF_HUMAN; GP1BA_HUMAN; ICAM1_HUMAN; PGRP2_HUMAN; HPHL1_HUMAN; FA5_HUMAN; EGFR_HUMAN; GRN_HUMAN; ENTP7_HUMAN; POSTN_HUMAN; TENA_HUMAN; CHADL_HUMAN; CA2D1_HUMAN; SEPR_HUMAN; NDST1_HUMAN; NRP1_HUMAN; FSTL5_HUMAN; PRTG_HUMAN; MA2B1_HUMAN; CR2_HUMAN; LAMB1_HUMAN; HMCN2_HUMAN

Innate immunity	Biological process	Protein involved in innate immunity, an inborn defense mechanism used by organisms to defend themselves against invasion by pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.). Initially discovered in insects which are devoid of an adaptive immune system and rely only on innate immune reactions for their defense, this immediate response accomplishes many activities including recognition and effector functions. Recognition is mediated by broad specificity, pattern recognition, receptors which recognize many related molecular structures (e.g. polysaccharides, polynucleotides) present in microorganisms but not found in the host. The innate responses include the release of antimicrobial peptides, production of cytokines, acute- phase proteins, complement. Although many different innate immune mechanisms are deployed for host defence, a unifying theme of innate immunity is the use of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors for pathogens or damaged self components, such as the Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (LRR)- containing receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like RNA helicases and C-type lectin receptors.		41	CO3_HUMAN; IC1_HUMAN; CO4B_HUMAN; C4BPA_HUMAN; CFAH_HUMAN; CFAH_HUMAN; CFAB_HUMAN; C1QA_HUMAN; CO5_HUMAN; CLUS_HUMAN; CO9_HUMAN; CO8B_HUMAN; CO2_HUMAN; FIBA_HUMAN; CO8A_HUMAN; CO7_HUMAN; CFAI_HUMAN; C1S_HUMAN; C1R_HUMAN; CO6_HUMAN; S10AC_HUMAN; FIBB_HUMAN; C1QB_HUMAN; C4BPB_HUMAN; CO8G_HUMAN; CD14_HUMAN; PROP_HUMAN; S10A9_HUMAN; CO3_HUMAN; CFAD_HUMAN; MASP1_HUMAN; SLPI_HUMAN; LBP_HUMAN; IL1AP_HUMAN; FIBA_HUMAN; C4BPA_HUMAN; BPIA1_HUMAN; MASP2_HUMAN; CSF1R_HUMAN; DAF_HUMAN; CR2_HUMAN

Parkinson disease is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder, usually occurring in late life, although an early onset and a juvenile form are known. Typical features are masklike facies, tremor of resting muscles, a slowing of voluntary movements (bradykinesia), festinating gait and postural instability. The signs and symptoms of the disease are the consequence of a striatal deficiency of dopamine, resulting from neuronal death in the substantia nigra. Parkinson disease is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, intraneuronal inclusions found in many brain regions which are not entirely specific to, but are a highly sensitive marker for, Parkinson disease.

The stress is usually, but not necessarily, exogenous (e.g. temperature, humidity, ionizing radiation, hypertonicity, amino acid deprivation).		2	PARK7_HUMAN; HSP7C_HUMAN
Tumor suppressor	Disease	Protein that suppresses tumorigenesis. Tumor suppressors generally function as negative regulators of cell cycle progression or cell proliferation. They may act to enforce cell cycle arrest in response to specific signals, such as DNA damage, thereby allowing DNA repair to occur prior to DNA replication. Tumor suppressors that act in this way include TP53 and its downstream effector CDKN1A/p21. They may also act to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to specific developmental signals or under circumstances where DNA repair cannot be completed. Tumor suppressors that act in this way include PTEN and BAX.	Anti-oncogene; Antitumor	2	PARK7_HUMAN; DMBT1_HUMAN

An accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen triggers a stress response, resulting in the transcriptional induction in the nucleus of a set of genes, whose products are involved in protein folding, assembly and modification as well as in phospholipid biosynthesis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is the intracellular pathway that mediates signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus. UPR is also tightly linked to ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). UPR is a ubiquitous mechanism observed in all eukaryotes from humans to yeast.
